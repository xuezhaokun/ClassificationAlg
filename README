** It takes about 20 - 30 minutes to finish running the whole project **
how to run:

1. extract the .zip file 
	unzip pp3.zip


2. cd to the project directory
	cd ClassificationAlg/


3. run the .jar file
	java -jar pp3.jar


If you need to look at the code, just cd to the code directory 
	cd src/pp3


If you need to check the raw data I got from the project, just cd to the results directory
	cd results

The files in results have the same form as the results given in console
